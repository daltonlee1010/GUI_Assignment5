Description: This assignment ties in all of what we learned throughout GUI 1 this semester.
The goal is to program a website using html, css, js (with jQuery UI for drag and drop mechanics)
that allows users to play "mini scrabble". The final product is one line, with two bonus squares, off a scrabble board
with a rack underneath holding seven letter tiles that can be dragged and dropped onto the board squares.
The program checks word is real (extra credit), has two letters and no gaps before allowing submission of a word.
There is 100 tiles total to be drawn per game, games can be reset, a highscore across all games is tracked,
bonus tiles properly handle score multipliers/additions upon display and submission and the current word is
displayed to the user and gets updated as tiles are added/removed from the board.
