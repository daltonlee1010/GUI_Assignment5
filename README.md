Description: This assignment ties in all of what we learned throughout GUI 1 this semester.<br>
The goal is to program a website using html, css, js (with jQuery UI for drag and drop mechanics)<br>
that allows users to play "mini scrabble". The final product is one line, with two bonus squares, off a scrabble board<br>
with a rack underneath holding seven letter tiles that can be dragged and dropped onto the board squares.<br>
The program checks word is real (extra credit), has two letters and no gaps before allowing submission of a word.<br>
There is 100 tiles total to be drawn per game, games can be reset, a highscore across all games is tracked,<br>
bonus tiles properly handle score multipliers/additions upon display and submission and the current word is<br>
displayed to the user and gets updated as tiles are added/removed from the board.<br>
